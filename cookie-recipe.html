    <h3>History of cookies</h3>
      <p>cookies appear to have their origins in the 7th century AD Persia, shortly after the use of sugar became relatively common in the region. they spread to Europe through the muslim conquest of spain by the 14th century, they were  common in all levels of society throughout europe, from royal cuisine to street vendors </p>
      <p>With global travel becoming widespread at that time, cookies made a natural travel companion, a modernized equivalent of the travel cakes used through out the history. one of the most popular early cookies, which traveled especially well and became known on every continent by similar names, was the jumble, a relatively hard cookie made largely from nuts, sweeterner, and water </p>
      <p>the most common mordern cookie, given its style by creaming of butter and sugar, was not common until the 18th century</p>
